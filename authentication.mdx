description: How to authenticate with the ReserNow API for secure booking management
---

## API Authentication Overview

You authenticate with the ReserNow API using API keys to ensure secure access to your booking data. Authentication is required for all API requests except public endpoints like service listings.

<Callout kind="info">Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly.</Callout>

## Obtaining API Keys

You generate API keys through your ReserNow dashboard. Navigate to the API settings section and create a new key with appropriate permissions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Dashboard" icon="settings">
    You log in to your ReserNow dashboard and navigate to the API section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Key" icon="plus">
    You click "Create API Key" and enter a descriptive name for the key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Permissions" icon="lock">
    You select the appropriate permissions for the key, such as read-only or full access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store Securely" icon="shield">
    You copy the generated key and store it securely in your application environment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using API Keys

You include your API key in the Authorization header for all authenticated requests. The key format is "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY".

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript" icon="code">
    ```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.RESERNOW_API_KEY;

const response = await fetch('/api/bookings', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const bookings = await response.json();
console.log(bookings);
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python" icon="code">
    ```python
import os
import requests

api_key = os.getenv('RESERNOW_API_KEY')

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('/api/bookings', headers=headers)
bookings = response.json()
print(bookings)
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL" icon="terminal">
    ```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.resernow.com/bookings' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Key Permissions

You assign different permission levels to your API keys based on the operations you need to perform. This follows the principle of least privilege.

| Permission Level | Description | Allowed Operations |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Read-only | View data only | GET requests |
| Read-write | View and modify | GET, POST, PUT, PATCH |
| Admin | Full access | All operations including DELETE |

<Expandable title="Managing Multiple Keys" default-open="false">
  You create separate API keys for different applications or environments. This allows you to revoke access for specific keys without affecting others.

  For example, you use one key for your production website and another for development testing.
</Expandable>

## Security Best Practices

You implement several security measures to protect your API keys and data.

<Callout kind="danger">Never commit API keys to version control systems.</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Environment Variables" icon="settings">
    You store API keys as environment variables, not in your code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Key Rotation" icon="refresh-cw">
    You rotate keys regularly and update them in your applications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Usage" icon="eye">
    You monitor API usage patterns for unusual activity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="IP Restrictions" icon="lock">
    You restrict API access to specific IP addresses if possible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Error Handling

You handle authentication errors gracefully in your application. Common error codes include 401 for invalid keys and 403 for insufficient permissions.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/bookings', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    if (response.status === 401) {
      throw new Error('Invalid API key');
    } else if (response.status === 403) {
      throw new Error('Insufficient permissions');
    }
  }
  
  const data = await response.json();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Authentication error:', error.message);
}
```
  ```python
try:
    response = requests.get('/api/bookings', headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'})
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    if e.response.status_code == 401:
        print("Invalid API key")
    elif e.response.status_code == 403:
        print("Insufficient permissions")
    else:
        print(f"HTTP error: {e}")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limits to prevent abuse. You monitor your request rates and implement backoff strategies for rate-limited requests.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Rate Limit Headers" default-open="false">
    Response headers include rate limit information: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, and X-RateLimit-Reset.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Handling Rate Limits" default-open="false">
    When you receive a 429 status code, you wait until the reset time before making additional requests.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Testing Authentication

You test your authentication setup using the API's test endpoints before deploying to production.

<Callout kind="tip">Use the `/api/test` endpoint to verify your API key is working correctly.</Callout>
