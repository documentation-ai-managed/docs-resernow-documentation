## Webhook Overview

You use webhooks to receive real-time notifications about booking events in ReserNow. Webhooks deliver data instantly when events occur, enabling you to build responsive integrations.

<Callout kind="info">Webhooks are more efficient than polling the API for updates.</Callout>

## Setting Up Webhooks

You configure webhooks through your ReserNow dashboard or API. Each webhook endpoint receives notifications for specific events.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Endpoint" icon="plus">
    You set up an HTTP endpoint in your application to receive webhook payloads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register Webhook" icon="settings">
    You register the endpoint URL in ReserNow with desired events.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection" icon="check-circle">
    You test the webhook to ensure proper delivery.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Payloads" icon="code">
    You implement logic to process incoming webhook data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Events

You can subscribe to various booking-related events. Each event type delivers specific data payloads.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Booking Events" icon="calendar">
    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `booking.created` | New booking created |
    | `booking.updated` | Booking modified |
    | `booking.cancelled` | Booking cancelled |
    | `booking.completed` | Service finished |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Customer Events" icon="user">
    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `customer.created` | New customer added |
    | `customer.updated` | Customer info changed |
    | `customer.deleted` | Customer removed |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Staff Events" icon="users">
    | Event | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `staff.created` | New staff member |
    | `staff.updated` | Staff info changed |
    | `staff.deleted` | Staff member removed |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Webhook Payloads

Webhook payloads contain structured JSON data with event details. You receive information about the affected resource and the type of change.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
// Example booking.created payload
{
  "event": "booking.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "bk_123456",
    "serviceId": "haircut",
    "customerId": "cus_789",
    "staffId": "staff_456",
    "startTime": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "duration": 60,
    "status": "confirmed",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-10T08:30:00Z"
  },
  "webhookId": "wh_abc123"
}

// Handling the webhook
app.post('/webhooks/resernow', (req, res) => {
  const { event, data } = req.body;
  
  switch (event) {
    case 'booking.created':
      // Process new booking
      console.log('New booking:', data.id);
      break;
    case 'booking.cancelled':
      // Handle cancellation
      console.log('Cancelled booking:', data.id);
      break;
  }
  
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```
  ```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhooks/resernow', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    data = request.get_json()
    event = data.get('event')
    booking_data = data.get('data')
    
    if event == 'booking.created':
        # Process new booking
        print(f'New booking: {booking_data["id"]}')
    elif event == 'booking.cancelled':
        # Handle cancellation
        print(f'Cancelled booking: {booking_data["id"]}')
    
    return jsonify({'status': 'ok'}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Security and Verification

You verify webhook authenticity using signatures to ensure messages come from ReserNow.

<Expandable title="Webhook Signatures" default-open="false">
  Each webhook request includes an X-ReserNow-Signature header. You verify this signature using your webhook secret to confirm the request's authenticity.

  <Callout kind="danger">Always verify webhook signatures to prevent malicious requests.</Callout>
</Expandable>

## Error Handling and Retries

You handle webhook delivery failures gracefully. ReserNow retries failed deliveries with exponential backoff.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Respond Quickly" icon="zap">
    You respond to webhook requests within 10 seconds to avoid timeouts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Failures" icon="alert-circle">
    You implement error handling for network issues and processing failures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Idempotency" icon="refresh-cw">
    You make webhook processing idempotent to handle duplicate deliveries.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Management

You manage your webhooks through the dashboard or API, including creation, updates, and deactivation.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Testing Webhooks" default-open="false">
    Use the webhook testing tools in your dashboard to send test events and verify your endpoint's behavior.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Monitoring" default-open="false">
    Monitor webhook delivery rates and response times to ensure reliable operation.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Common Use Cases

You implement webhooks for various integration scenarios.
