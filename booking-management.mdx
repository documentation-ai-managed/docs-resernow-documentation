## Booking Lifecycle

You manage the complete booking lifecycle from creation to completion using ReserNow's comprehensive API. The system handles all stages automatically while giving you full control over the process.

<Callout kind="info">Bookings can be created through the API, dashboard, or customer-facing booking widgets.</Callout>

## Creating Bookings

You create bookings by specifying the service, customer, and time slot. The API validates availability and prevents conflicts automatically.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Availability" icon="search">
    You query available time slots for your desired service and date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Time" icon="clock">
    You choose an available time slot that meets your requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Booking" icon="plus">
    You submit the booking with customer and service details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm" icon="check">
    You receive a booking confirmation with unique ID and details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Booking States

Bookings progress through different states as they move through their lifecycle. You can track and update booking status programmatically.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Active States" icon="play">
    | State | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `pending` | Awaiting confirmation |
    | `confirmed` | Booking confirmed |
    | `in_progress` | Service in progress |
    | `completed` | Service finished |
  </Tab>

    | `cancelled` | Booking cancelled |
    | `no_show` | Customer didn't arrive |
  </Tab>

## Managing Availability

You define and manage availability rules that control when bookings can be made. This includes business hours, staff schedules, and blocked time periods.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
// Get available slots for a service
async function getAvailableSlots(serviceId, date) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/services/${serviceId}/availability?date=${date}`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
  });
  return response.json();
}

// Example usage
const slots = await getAvailableSlots('haircut', '2024-01-15');
console.log('Available slots:', slots);
```
  ```python
def get_available_slots(service_id, date):
    response = requests.get(
        f'/api/services/{service_id}/availability',
        params={'date': date},
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
    )
    return response.json()

# Example usage
